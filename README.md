# Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Auckland, New Zealand
## A-new-shopping-mall-in-Auckland-Clustering
In this project, we will explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in Auckland. What is interesting about the field of data science is that each project can be challenging in finding the required data. For Auckland neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Auckland. we have to scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format.

Once the data is in a structured format, we can explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Auckland.
